Gets the number of people: The code then prompts the user to enter the number of people who will be splitting the bill using the input() function. The int() function is then used to convert the input from a string to an integer.

Calculates the tip amount: The code calculates the tip amount by multiplying the bill amount by the tip percentage and then dividing by 100 (to convert from a percentage to a decimal).

Calculates the total bill amount: The code calculates the total bill amount by adding the tip amount to the bill amount.

Calculates the amount per person: The code calculates the amount each person should pay by dividing the total bill amount by the number of people. The round() function is used to round the result to two decimal places.
